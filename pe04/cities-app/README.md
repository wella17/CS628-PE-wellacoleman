# Cities Application README

Welcome to the Cities Application! This app allows users to input city names, process the data, and obtain relevant information about the cities.

## Input
Users can input city names through a user-friendly interface. The app may support manual input, autocomplete suggestions, or importing data from external sources.

## Process
1. The app receives the input city name from the user.
2. It performs a search or query to gather relevant data about the city from its database or external APIs.
3. Data processing includes extracting details like population, geographical coordinates, landmarks, and other key information.
4. The app may perform data validation and error handling to ensure accurate results.

## Output
Once the data processing is complete, the app generates informative output for the user:
- City name
- Population
- Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- Landmarks and notable features
- Additional information (climate, demographics, etc.)
