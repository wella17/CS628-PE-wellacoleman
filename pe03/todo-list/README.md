## My To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List app built with React. It allows users to add and remove tasks from the list.

## Input

The input for this app is the description of the task entered by the user. This input is provided through a text input field on the user interface. Users can type the task description into the input field.

## Process

The process of the app involves the following steps:
Adding a New Task: When the user enters a task description in the input field and clicks the "Add Task" button, the app checks if the input is not empty (whitespace is trimmed). If it's not empty, a new task object is created with a unique ID (generated using the current timestamp) and the input text. The new task is then added to the list of tasks using the setTodos function to update the todos state, and the input field is cleared.

Removing a Task: Each task in the list is displayed as an individual component with a "Delete" button. When the user clicks the "Delete" button for a particular task, the app triggers the handleRemoveTodo function, passing the ID of the task to be removed. The handleRemoveTodo function uses the setTodos function to update the todos state by filtering out the task with the corresponding ID, effectively removing it from the list.

## Output

The output of the app is the list of tasks that the user has added. Each task is displayed in a separate component, showing the task description and a "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
